a) Source of the data: https://github.com/hassoun/nba/tree/master/data

b) I decided to create tables to organize the teams, games played, and players. The teams hold the most 
unique values, while the other columns hold foreign keys related to each team. 

c) The hardest part about mapping the data was organizing the foreign key constraints to ensure
the tables were holding all available data with approppraite MySQL relationships. 

d) Non-trivial questions:
    i. How many home games did Al Horford play in?
    ii. How does changing the data in the "team" table affect other tables?
    iii. Is there another way for this data to be organized with less/more tables?
